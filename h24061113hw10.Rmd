## Use as a calculator
```
 + (add), - (subtract), * (multiply), and / (divide)
 compute powers with the ^ operator
```

Modular arithmetic is also available.     
For example,you can compute the remainder after division of 31 by 7
```{r}
31 %% 7
```
 the integer part of a fraction as
```{r}
31 %/% 7
```

the sequence of integers from 17 to 28 may be displayed :
```{r}
17:28
```

## Standard formula
```
mean(x)
sum(x)
var(x) # variance 
summary(x) #  summary  
length(x) # number of elements in x 
min(x) # minimum value of x 
max(x) # maximum value of x 
pmin(x, y) # pairwise minima of corresponding elements of x and y 
pmax(x, y) # pairwise maxima of x and y 
range(x) # difference between maximum and minimum of data in x 
IQR(x) # interquartile range: difference between 1st and 3rd # quartiles of data in x
```

### Quitting R
```
q()
```
###Getting help
If you know the name of the function that you need help with, the help() functionislikelysufficient.
You can put a question mark (?) in front of your query. 
```
example: ?q
help( )
```
Another function that is often used is help.search(), abbreviated as a double question mark.
For example,to see whether there are any functions that do optimization (finding minima or maxima)
```
??optimization
help.search("optimization")
```

##Packages,libraries,and repositories

When you start your R session,you will have some packages loaded and available for use, while others are stored on your computer in a library.
```
library() 
```
To see which packages are loaded
```{r}
search()
```
```
library(notInstalled)
## Error in library(notInstalled): there is no package called 'notInstalled'
```
This means that the package doesn't exist on your computer,but it might be available in a repository online.
you can run a command like
```
install.packages(" ")
```

### Simple patterned vectors 

Patterned vectors can also be produced using the seq() function as well as the rep() function. 


 The seq() function has several optional parameters, including one named by. Ifby is not specified, the default value of 1 will be used.
 
 
 ```{r}
 seq(1, 21, by = 2)
 ```

Repeated patterns are obtained using rep(). 

```{r}
rep(3, 12)
rep(seq(2, 20, by = 2), 2)
```

### Vectors with random patterns 

sample() function allows us to simulate things like the results of the repeated tossing of a 6-sided die.
```{r}
sample(1:6, size = 8, replace = TRUE) 
```

###Character vectors
```
more.colors 
```
```{r}
colors <- c("red", "yellow", "blue") 
more.colors <- c(colors, "green", "magenta", "cyan") 
```
```
substr()
```
To take substrings, use substr(). It takes arguments substr(x, start, stop), where x is a vector of character strings, and start and stop say which characters to keep. 

##Factors
Factors offer an alternative way to store character data. 
```
factor() 
```
 To see what the codes are for our factor, we can type
```
as.integer()
```
The labels for the levels are stored just once each, rather than being repeated. The codes are indices of the vector of levels
```
levels()
levels()[as.integer()]
```

##Matrices and arrays 

**matrices**
To arrange values into a matrix, we use the matrix() function:
```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
m
```
We can then access elements using two indices
```{r}
m[1, 2]
```
Whole rows or columns of matrices may be selected by leaving one index blank:
```{r}
m[1,]
m[,1]
```

**array**
A more general way to store data is in an array. Arrays have multiple indices, and are created using the array function:
```{r}
a <- array(1:24, c(3, 4, 2)) 
a
```

### Missing values and other special values 
The missing value symbol is NA.
```{r}
some.evens <- NULL # creates a vector with no elements 
some.evens[seq(2, 20, 2)] <- seq(2, 20, 2) 
some.evens
```
also R uses NA to signal that the value is unknown.
```{r}
x <- c(0, 1, 2) 
x / x
```
Here R has tried to evaluate 1/0 and reports the infinite result as Inf. 
When there may be missing values, the is.na() function should be used to detect them. 
```{r}
is.na(some.evens)
```
The ! symbol means 'not'
```{r}
!is.na(some.evens)
some.evens[!is.na(some.evens)]
```

##Graphics Functions 
histogram
scatterplot
```{r}
hist(islands) 
x <- seq(1, 10) 
y <- x^2 - 10*x 
plot(x, y)
```
```
curve()   function 
```
A simple example involves plotting the sine function on the interval [0,6*pi]:
```{r}
curve(expr = sin, from = 0, to = 6 * pi)
```

###The sample median
```
median(x)
```



##Logical vectors
contain two different elements: TRUE and FALSE, as well as NA for missing.

###Boolean algebra 

![Truth table for Boolean operation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Truth_table_for_AND%2C_OR%2C_and_NOT.png)

##Data frames and lists
summary() function provides a quick peek at this data set: 
```
summary
```
Most data sets are stored in R as dataframes.
These are like matrices,but with the columns having their own names.
Better ways to view the data are through the use of the summary() function as shown below, or by constructing an appropriate graph 
```
plot(y ~ x, data = ). 
```
For larger dataframes,a quick way of counting the number of rows and columns is important.
```
 nrow() 
 ncol()
```
We can get both at once using dim() (for dimension):
```
dim( )
```
get summary information using str() (for structure):
```
str
```
**Data frame columns can also be addressed using their names using the $ operator. **

**The with() function allows us to access columns of a data frame directly without using the $. **

##Taking random samples from populations 
```
sampleID <- sample(1:15000, size = 8, replace = FALSE)
sampleID
```
## Lists
You can see the names of the objects in a list using the names() function, and extract parts of it:
```
names(d) # Print the names of the objects in the d data frame. 
d$x # Print the x component of d

```
The list() function is one way of organizing multiple pieces of output from functions. 

```{r}
x <- c(3, 2, 3) 
y <- c(7, 7) 
z <- list(x = x,y = y) 
z
```

There are several functions which make working with lists easy.Two of them are lapply() and vapply(). 
**lapply()**:
  function 'applies' another function to every element of a list and returns the results in a new list; for example:
```{r}
lapply(z, mean)
```

** vapply()**:
  have the results in a vector;
```{r}
vapply(z, mean, 1)
```
 If mean() had returned a different kind of result, vapply() would have given an error. 
 If we expect more than a single value, the results will be organized into a matrix.
````{r}
vapply(z, summary, numeric(6))
```

##Data input and output 

###setwd()
** Set As Working Directory**
For example,to work with data in the folder mydata on the "C:drive", run
```
setwd("c:/mydata") # or setwd("c:\\mydata")
```

###dump()
Suppose you have constructed an R object called usefuldata. In order to save this object for a future session.
```{r}
dump("usefuldata", "useful.R")
```
To save all of the objects that you have created during a sessin.
```{r}
dump(list = objects(), "all.R")
```

###source() 
To retrieve the vector in a future session.
```
source("useful.R")
```

### Redirecting R output 
By default,R directs the output of most of its functions to the screen.Output can be directed to a file with the sink() function.
```
sink() # Close solarmean.txt; print new output to screen
```

###Saving and retrieving image files 
save workspace images without quitting
```
save.image("temp.RData")
```

###The read.table function 
If such a data set is stored in a file called pretend.dat in the directory myfiles on the C: drive, then it can be read into an R data frame.
```
pretend.df <- read.table("c:/myfiles/pretend.dat", header =TRUE)
```
Reading in such a file with blank missing values:
```
dataset1 <read.table("file1.txt", header = TRUE, sep = ",", na.string = "" ) 
```
Reading in such a file with columns separated by tabs with blank missing values can be carried out using 
```
dataset2 <read.table("file2.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t", na.string = "" ) 
```

##High level plots

### Bar charts and dot charts 
**barchart**
```{r}
WorldPhones51 <- WorldPhones[1,] 
WorldPhones51
```
```{r}
barplot(WorldPhones51)
```
```{r}
barplot(WorldPhones51, cex.names = 0.75, cex.axis = 0.75, main = "Numbers of Telephones in 1951")
```

**dot chart**
```{r}
dotchart(WorldPhones51, xlab = "Numbers of Phones ('000s)")
```

###Pie charts 
```{r}
groupsizes <- c(18, 30, 32, 10, 10) 
labels <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "F")
pie(groupsizes, labels, col = c("grey40", "white", "grey", "black", "grey90"))
```

###Histograms
```{r}
hist(log(1000*islands, 10), xlab = "Area (on base 10 log scale)", main = "Areas of the World's Largest Landmasses")
```
If you have n values of x, R, by default, divides the range into approximately log2(n)+1 intervals, giving rise to that number of bars.
```{r}
length(islands)
```
```
5<log2(48)<6
```

### Box plots 
1. A horizontal line is drawn at the median. 
2. Split the data into two halves, each containing the median.
3. Calculate the upper and lower quartiles as the medians of each half,and draw horizontal lines at each of these values. 
  Then connect the lines to form a rectangular box.
The box thus drawn defines the interquartile range (IQR). This is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile. 
```{r}
boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, ylab = "Sepal length (cm)", main = "Iris measurements", boxwex = 0.5)
```

### Scatterplots 
```{r}
x <- rnorm(100) 
# assigns 100 random normal observations to x 
y <- rpois(100, 30) 
# assigns 100 random Poisson observations 
#to y; mean value is 30 
mean(y) 
# the resulting value should be near 30
```
```{r}
plot(x, y, main = "Poisson versus Normal")
```
```{r}
plot(x, y, pch = 16) # changes the plot symbol to a solid dot 
plot(x, y, type = 'l') # plots a broken line (a dense tangle of line # segments here) 
plot(sort(x), sort(y), type = 'l') # a plot of the sample "quantiles"
```

## QQ plots 
**Quantile-quantile plots **
A type of scatterplot used to compare the distributions of two groups or to compare a sample with a reference distribution. 
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,4)) 
X <- rnorm(1000) 
A <- rnorm(1000) 
qqplot(X, A, main = "A and X are the same")

B <- rnorm(1000, mean = 3, sd = 2) 
qqplot(X, B, main = "B is rescaled X")

C <- rt(1000, df = 2) 
qqplot(X, C, main = "C has heavier tails")

D <- rexp(1000) 
qqplot(X, D, main = "D is skewed to the right")

```

##Low level graphics functions
###The plotting region and margins 
![margin](http://users.monash.edu.au/~murray/AIMS-R-users/ws/images/graphics-figureAnatomy1.png)

### Adding to plots 
```
points(x, y, ...) # adds points 
lines(x, y, ...) # adds line segments 
text(x, y, labels, ...) # adds text into the graph 
abline(a, b, ...) # adds the line $y = a + bx$ 
abline(h = y, ...) # adds a horizontal line 
abline(v = x, ...) # adds a vertical line 
polygon(x, y, ...) 
  # adds a closed and possibly filled polygon 
segments(x0, y0, x1, y1, ...) # draws line segments arrows(x0, y0, x1, y1, ...) # draws arrows 
symbols(x, y, ...) # draws circles, squares, thermometers, etc. 
legend(x, y, legend, ...) # draws a legend 
title(main, sub, xlab, ylab, ...) # adds a main title, a subtitle, an x-axis label and/or a y-axis label 
mtext(text, side, line, ...) # draws text in the margins 
axis(side, at, labels, ...) # adds an axis to the plot 
box(...) # adds a box 
```

## Other graphics systems
###The ggplot2 package
```{r}
library(ggplot2) 
region <- names(WorldPhones51) 
phones51 <- data.frame(Region = factor(region, levels = region), Telephones = WorldPhones51) 
ggplot(phones51, aes(Region, Telephones)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")

## Constructing matrix objects 
```
matrix(data, nrow, ncol) # data is a vector of nrow*ncol values 
cbind(d1, d2, ..., dm) # d1, ..., dm are vectors (columns) 
rbind(d1, d2, ..., dn) # d1, ..., dn are vectors (rows)
```

##Matrix properties 
```
dim()
det()
diag()
```
```
trace()
t()     #calculate the matrix transpose 
```
The diag() function can also be used to turn a vector into a square diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements correspond to the entries of the given vector.
```
diag(diag())
```

###Triangular matrices 
lower and upper triangular parts of matrices
```
lower.tri()
upper.tri() 
```

## Matrix multiplication and inversion
** Matrix multiplication can be performed using the operator %*% **
```
t(Y) %*% X
```

### Matrix inversion in R 
Matrices are inverted and linear systems of equations are solved using the solve() or qr.solve() functions. solve() uses a method based on the LU decomposition ;qr.solve()is based on the QR decomposition 
```
 solve() 
 qr.solve() 
```
** Solving linear systems **
The function solve(A, b) gives the solution to systems of equations of the form Ax=b. 

Find x such that H3x=b, where H3 is the 3??3 Hilbert matrix and b=[1 2 3]^T. 
```
b <- c(1, 2, 3) 
x <- solve(H3, b) 
x
```
 
### Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed using the function eigen().
```
eigen()
``` 
 
##Other matrix decompositions
The singular value decomposition of a square matrix A consists of three square matrices,U, D andV. The matrix D is a diagonal matrix. 
A=UD(V^T)
The singular value decomposition can be obtained using the function svd().
```
svd()
```
For example,the singular value decomposition of the 3x3 Hilbert matrix H3 
```
H3.svd <- svd(H3) 
H3.svd
```
verify that these components can be multiplied in the appropriate way to reconstruct H3.:
```
H3.svd$u %*% diag(H3.svd$d) %*% t(H3.svd$v)
```

```
#H3^(-1)=V(D^(-1))(U^(T)):
H3.svd$v %*% diag(1/H3.svd$d) %*% t(H3.svd$u)
```

### The Choleski decomposition of a positive 
B^2=A
 The Choleski decomposition is similar, but the idea is to find an upper triangular matrix U such that (U^T)U =A. 
```
chol() 
```
A=(U^T)U
compute the inverse of A using :
A^(-1) = U^(-1)*(U^(-T) )
```
chol2inv() 
```

### The QR decomposition of a matrix 
A=QR
Ax=b
QRx=b
Rx=(Q^T)b
This is an easier system to solve, because R is an upper triangular matrix.
 (Q^T)b is an easily calculated n-vector
```
qr()
```
qr.Q() and qr.R() can be applied to this object to obtain the explicit Q and R matrices.
```
qr.Q() 
qr.R()
```
For example :
We can recover H3 by multiplying Q by R:
```
Q %*% R
```
we can simply to demonstrate that the decomposition can be used to get at the inverse of a matrix
```
qr.solve(R) %*% t(Q)
```
